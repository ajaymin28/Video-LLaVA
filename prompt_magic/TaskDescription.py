- subject is an entity who is performing action in the scene, or entity selected to describe it's spatial placement in the scene (e.g. antelope, table, cat, person etc.)
- The #id in (subject-#id and object-#id) is a randomly assigned unique identifier used to distinguish objects of the same category and track the objects throughout the scene.
- predicate describes what subject is doing in the scene with object or describes subject's placement in the scene with respect to other objects. (e.g. holding, standing next to, drinking etc.)
- object is an entity which receives the action done by subject or its used as a reference to which subjects spatial position is given.

# - subject is an entity who is performing action in the scene, or entity selected to describe it's spatial placement in the scene (e.g. antelope, table, cat, person etc.)
# - The #id in (subject-#id and object-#id) is a unique identifier used to distinguish objects of the same category (e.g., adult-1, adult-3, table-4 etc.)
# - predicate describes what subject is doing in the scene with object or describes subject's placement in the scene with respect to other objects. (e.g. holding, standing next to, drinking etc.)
# - object is an entity which receives the action done by subject or its used as a reference to which subjects spatial position is given.

# For example: [person-1,holding,cup-2];[child-3,running on,floor-0];[child-3,sitting on,sofa-10]

# Now follow the steps below.
# 1. Generate triplets from the provided video in the format [subject-#id, predicate, object-#id], use the provided subjects/objects and predicate lists to generate triplets: subjects/objects: {List_of_objects} and predicates: {List_of_predicates}.

#     Task: Describe video using Scene Graph Triplets in the format [subject-#id, predicate, object-#id].

#     Definitions:
#     - subject-#id: A visual object or noun in the video that performs an action or plays a role(actor) in the scene. The #id is a unique identifier used to distinguish objects of the same category (e.g., multiple people).
#     - predicate: Describes the action (verb) or spatial relationship between objects in the scene.
#     - object-#id: A visual object or noun in the video affected by the subject's action or shows spatial relationship with respect to other objects in the scene.

#     Example 1:
#         - [person-1,holding,cup-2];[child-3,running on,floor-0]
    
#     Notes: 
#         - Remember to assign unique #id to all objects without repeating the same objects in the scene.
#         - There can be N number of same category of objects but make sure they are visible in the video before assigning them the #id.

#     Now follow the steps below:

#     1. From the given video, construct meaningful scene graph triplets in the format [subject-#id, predicate, object-#id].
#         - Assign a unique #id to each object if more than one of the same category is present.
#         - Ensure that the subjects/objects in the triplets are visible in the video.

# 2. Using the output from Step 1, map each subject, object, and predicate to the corresponding entries in the provided list of subjects/objects {List_of_objects} and predicates {List_of_predicates}.
#         - Keep the #ids consistent during mapping.
#         - Ensure that the meaning of the original triplets remains unchanged during the mapping process.

# Notes:
#     - Triplets must be unique and describe meaningful interactions or spatial relations between objects in the scene.
#     - Use common sense when generating or mapping the triplets.
#     - If an object in the provided list is not visible in the video, do not use it to generate triplets.

    Task: Scene graph triplet prediction in the format [subject-#id, predicate, object-#id] from the given video.
        - subject is a visual object or noun which is present in the video which can be seen as an entity who is performing action or is an actor in the scene.
            - here #id in subject-#id describes or tags the object visible in the scene to have uniqueness, if more than one objects of similar category are visible in the scene.
        - predicate can be an action(verb) which describes what the subject is doing in the scene or spatial relation for how objects are positioned to each other in the scene.
        - object is a visual object or noun which is present in the video which is described by the predicate and subject combination, this object is affected by subject and predicate.

    Notes: 
        - Remember to assign unique #id to all objects without repeating the same objects in the scene.
        - There can be N number of same category of objects but make sure they are visible in the video before assigning them the #id.

    1. Describe the given video in the form of meaningful scene graph triplets in the format [subject-#id, predicate, object-#id]

    Notes:
        - Make sure the triplets are meaningful and with common sense and unique
